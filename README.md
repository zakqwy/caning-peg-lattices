# Caning Peg Lattice

Caning peg lattices are sturdy person-scale structures which can be quickly assembled from three parts: struts, nodes, and caning pegs. Assembly is accomplished using a simple tool assembled from one of each of these parts. This tool is also used to quickly disassemble the lattice for transport, storage, or re-configuration. Struts and nodes are milled from plywood, while caning pegs are commercially available tapered maple rods used in chair caning. The first iteration of the project used 3/4" (~19 mm) construction-grade plywood for struts and nodes, machined using a low-cost desktop CNC router. The nodes have three flat connection points at equal angles, so connecting them to neighboring nodes using struts results in a planar hexagonal lattice. Opposing pairs of nodes in the lattice measure roughly 16" (~400 mm) between centers, conveniently sized to hang on hooks installed in a US-spec stud wall.
